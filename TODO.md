# TODO

- Pregenerating + compiling step function and just change Model object with existing functions, would speed up model generations very significantly
- create "detail" palette akin to ncview's one
- Block software while generating model (spinning wheel cursor etc...)
- Save state if no model change ?
- Interactivity (drawing ICs / adding stuff during simul)

## Parameters
- Choose steps per frame
- Allow changing plotted variable
- Lx/Ly
- Record option (red round button + square button and name input at end ?)
